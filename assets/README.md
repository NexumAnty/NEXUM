# Assets

This directory contains visual and branding assets used across the NEXUM project.

All materials here are intended to support documentation, previews, and early-stage communication — not marketing hype.

---

## Contents

Typical assets stored in this directory may include:

- Product preview images
- UI mockups and early interface concepts
- Architecture diagrams
- Branding elements (logo, icons)
- Social preview images for repository sharing

Filenames and structure may evolve as the project matures.

---

## Usage Notes

- Assets are primarily referenced from `README.md` and documentation files
- Visuals represent the **current development direction**, not a finalized product
- UI previews are illustrative and may differ from final implementation

No images here imply completed functionality unless explicitly stated.

---

## Philosophy

NEXUM visuals aim to reflect the same principles as the codebase:

- clarity over decoration  
- minimalism over noise  
- honesty over exaggeration  

If something is experimental or unfinished, it is treated as such.

## License

Unless stated otherwise, assets are provided under the same license as the project.

If you have questions about usage or attribution, please open an issue.
