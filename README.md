# NEXUM Anti-Detection Browser

Privacy-first anti-detection browser focused on isolation, control, and transparency.  
Built by a solo developer. Early-stage startup.

> 🚧 **Status:** Pre-Alpha — active development  
> 🎁 **Early access:** Free for first 6 months

## Why NEXUM?

Most anti-detection browsers today are black boxes.  
They promise anonymity, but never explain *how* or *why* it works.

NEXUM is different.

This project started from a simple idea:

**What if an anti-detection browser was built like real infrastructure — not a growth hack?**

No hidden telemetry.  
No magic randomness.  
No unnecessary cloud dependency.

Just controlled, isolated, deterministic browser environments.

---

## Core Principles

- **Privacy-first** — no background tracking, no hidden analytics  
- **Local-first** — profiles are stored locally by default  
- **Isolation by design** — each profile is a separate runtime  
- **Transparency** — clear limits, no false guarantees  
- **Built slow, built right**

---

## Planned Features

> Features are implemented step by step. Nothing is “fake-ready”.

- Fingerprint masking & stabilization
- Unlimited isolated browser profiles
- Proxy support (HTTP / HTTPS / SOCKS)
- Hardware & environment spoofing
- Encrypted local profile storage
- Session export & import
- Optional team sharing (later stage)
- Minimal, distraction-free UI

## Who Is This For?

- Developers & security researchers  
- Marketers managing multiple accounts  
- Web scraping & automation professionals  
- Anyone who wants **control**, not promises

If you're looking for a “one-click magic anonymity tool” — this project is **not** for you.

If you want to understand and control your environment — welcome.
